<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br />

This repository is made to help aspiring software developers in learning Data Structures and Algorithms for their coding interviews.
<br />
<br />
This Repository consists of many <b>Data Structures and Algorithm Questions</b> and <b>Competitive Programming Questions</b> from the leading coding websites. You can take reference from the code you've been stuck with for very long. Hope this repository helps you :)

### Resources

* [LeetCode](www.leetcode.com)
* [CodeChef](www.codechef.com)
* [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com)
* [GeeksForGeeks](www.geeksforgeeks.com)
* [InterviewBit](www.interviewbit.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* You should have git installed in your local machine
* You should know any programming language, preferably JAVA since the code is in java

### Instructions

* Every question in this repository comes with the original link and the title of the question
  ```java
  import //(import files)
  // (Question Link)
  // (Question Title)
  public static void main(String[] args){
      // Driver code for normal questions whose input is simpler
  }
  //Functions used in the questions
  ```

### Installation

Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bugaliaa/codingquestions.git
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this repository in the following manner:
* Open the question from the link provided in the question file and try to solve it yourself
* If you're stuck then look at the code and try to understand the solution
* If you solved the question, you can still look at the solution provided for the best optimal solution
